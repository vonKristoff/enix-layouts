# Enix Frontend App

_note - main project overview is at the root readme.md_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

On `npm run build` the app bundle is distributed to the `/server/public` directory where the final app is run from.

IF you want to run the development env:

(Pre requisite - `npm install`)

View at `localhost:3000`

```
npm start // launches CRA && watches CSS
```

To enable the app to get data, the server must be running.

Navigate to `/server`

```
npm start 
```
